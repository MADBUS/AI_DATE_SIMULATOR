# Green Phase - Make the Test Pass

Write the MINIMUM code to make the failing test pass.

## Instructions

1. Look at the failing test
2. Write the simplest code that makes it pass
3. Do NOT:
   - Add extra functionality
   - Optimize prematurely
   - Handle edge cases not covered by tests
   - Refactor yet
4. Run ALL tests to confirm they pass

## Principles

- "Fake it till you make it" - return constants if that's all that's needed
- Write obvious implementations when they're simple enough
- Triangulate when you need to generalize

## Checklist
- [ ] Only wrote code required by the test
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No extra functionality added
- [ ] Ready for refactoring phase
