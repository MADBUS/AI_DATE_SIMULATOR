# Refactor Phase - Improve Structure

Improve code structure while keeping all tests passing.

## Prerequisites
- All tests must be passing (Green phase complete)

## Instructions

1. Identify ONE improvement to make:
   - Remove duplication
   - Improve naming
   - Extract method
   - Simplify logic
2. Make the change
3. Run tests to verify they still pass
4. Repeat if needed

## Common Refactorings

- **Extract Method**: Pull out a block of code into a named method
- **Rename**: Make names more descriptive
- **Inline**: Remove unnecessary indirection
- **Extract Variable**: Name a complex expression
- **Remove Duplication**: DRY principle

## Checklist
- [ ] Tests were passing before refactoring
- [ ] Made ONE structural change
- [ ] Tests still pass after change
- [ ] Code is cleaner/clearer
